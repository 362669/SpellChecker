# SpellChecker
Probabilistic Spelling Corrector
Author: Tomasz PosiadaÅ‚a

SpellChecker is a master's project that uses selected probabilistic methods to detect, classify and correct errors.
It is made in Visual Studio 2012.

Important before launch!!!
Before you run it on your computer, every file in folder named "putThisFilesOnServer" should be placed on your server direction.
It also uses Newtonsoft.Json library, which is not embeded, so you have to add the reference to .dll file manually (right click on your project --> Add reference...). 
The project contains this .dll file in location: SpellChecker/WebSpellChecker/bin/Newtonsoft.Json.dll.
